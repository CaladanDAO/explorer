# CaladanDAO Explorer

CaladanDAO indexes Ethereum and its L2 chains, and exposes a multi-chain block explorer at:

https://caladandao.org

This is the code for the block explorer, forked from [Colorful Notion's Polkaholic] (a Polkadot/Substrate multi-chain block explorer).

As of August 2023, both the index and the block explorer are a work-in-progress.

## Running 

To run the Block explorer:
```
# node index.js
```

By default, the configs use https://api.caladandao.org
